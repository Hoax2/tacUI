**Tac-UI**, is a [public domain](https://github.com/Hoax2/tac-ui/blob/main/LICENSE) UI-kit, for [tactical shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter), and [MilSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilSim#Video_games), [FPS games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter).

## Why?
Games in the Tac/MilSim genre are typically made by small independent studios or modding communities. As a fan of the genre, and an Interaction Designer, I want to contribute to the community, so that we can all make the games we love to play.\
